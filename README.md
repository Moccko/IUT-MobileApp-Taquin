# Taquin
A sliding puzzle (Taquin in French) for Android devices from API 21 Lollipop

This application for android was made during a school project. I used Android Studio 2.3 for Linux to develop this Android application. I built this program in one week which explains that the sources are (so) undocumented.

I helped myself with these websites :
The most : https://developer.android.com<br>
For handling the screen rotation (which was finally unimplemented) : http://techblogon.com/android-screen-orientation-change-rotation-example/<br>
The scores' management with SQLite : http://a-renouard.developpez.com/tutoriels/android/sqlite/<br>
The ListView tuning : http://www.tutomobile.fr/personnaliser-une-listview-tutoriel-android-n%C2%B07/04/07/2010/<br>
And for the ListView content : http://tutorielsandroid.com/tuto-android-creer-une-simple-listview/<br>
The few icons I used : https://material.io/icons/<br>
